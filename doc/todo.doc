*> Plan UI... only show mat-card if not plan._hidden

*> spinner when initial-loading ?  or add 'plan' to customClaims so quicker?
so no false 'select plan'

*> account component
allow payment, hold

*> migrate User
test if multiple instances of same source

*> account.pend should add all un-approve payments
*> getPayment should return the last from sorted list
*> getTimetable should also consider Calendar Events
*> do not include _default_ in State Observable
