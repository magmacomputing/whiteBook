/**

eg.

/public
	/provider
		/coinspot
				_signature: {
					index: n
					hash: XXX
					prev: YYY
				}

_signature.hash is a SHA256 over the Document (excluding the _signature field)
TBD *> what about _expire?  _modify?

on Snap #0, fire.sync will determine if IDB chain is valid (over whole table?)
	if invalid, clear IDB (whole table? or back to last-good?)
	re-build

on Snap #1+,
	on delete (what to do?)
	on update (what to do?)
	on insert:	mine a new block, add to IDB
